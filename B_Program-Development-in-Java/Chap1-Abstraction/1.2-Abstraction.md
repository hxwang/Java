Abstraction

### Advantage
- It allows use to forget information and consequently to treat things that are different as if they were the same.

### Example
- Problem: search upwards and search downwards to find whether there is an *e* exist in an array *a*
- A flaw design
```
found = a.isIn(e);
if(found) z = a.indexOf(e);
```
Disadvantage: it presumes that the designer of the programming language will build into the language most of the abstractions that users of the language will want. 
- Preferable design: design into the language mechanisms that allow programmers to construct their own abstractions as they need them. One common mechanism is the use of *procedure*. By separating procedure definition and invocation, a programming language makes two important methods of abstraction possible:
	- **abstraction by parameterization**: abstract from the identity of the data by replacing them with parameters. It generalize modules so that they an be used in more situations.
	- **abstraction by specification**: abstract from the implementation details. (how to module is implemented) to the behavior users can depend on(what the module does). It isolates from one another's implementations, we require only that a module's implementation supports the behavior being replied on.
