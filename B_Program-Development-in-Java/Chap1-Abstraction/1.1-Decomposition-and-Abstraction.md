Decomposition and Abstraction
=============================

### Decomposition
- **Goal**
	- Create modules that are themselves small programs that interact with one another in simple, well-defined ways. If we achieve this goal, different people will be able to work on different modules independently. 
	- During program modification and maintenance, it will be possible to modify some of the modules without affecting all of the others.
- **How?** When decomposing a program, we factor it into separable subproblems in such a way that:
	- Each subproblem is at the same level of detail
	- Each subproblem can be solved independently
	- The solution to the subproblems can be combined to solve the original problem.
	
### Abstraction
- **Definition**: ignore certain details in an effort to convert the original problem to a simpler one.

### Decomposition v.s. Abstraction
- **Decomposition** is used to break software into components that can be combined to solve the original problem
- **Abstraction** assist in making a good choice of components
- We alternate between these two processes until we have reduced the original problem to a set of problems we already know.
