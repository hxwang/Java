Decomposition and Abstraction
=============================

### Decomposition
- Idea: **Divide and Conquer**
- **Goal**
	- Create modules that are themselves small programs that interact with one another in simple, well-defined ways. If we achieve this goal, different people will be able to work on different modules independently. 
	- During program modification and maintenance, it will be possible to modify some of the modules without affecting all of the others.
- **How?** When decomposing a program, we factor it into separable subproblems in such a way that:
	- Each subproblem is at the same level of detail
	- Each subproblem can be solved independently
	- The solution to the subproblems can be combined to solve the original problem.
	
### Abstraction
- Function: **help to decompose productively**
- **Definition**: ignore certain details in an effort to convert the original problem to a simpler one.
	- A many-to-one mapping
	- "Abstracts" from "irrelevant" details

### Decomposition v.s. Abstraction
- **Decomposition** is used to break software into components that can be combined to solve the original problem
- **Abstraction** assist in making a good choice of components
- We alternate between these two processes until we have reduced the original problem to a set of problems we already know.

### Other abstraction*
- Procedural abstraction: allows use to introduce new operation
- Data abstraction: allows us to introduce new types of data objects
- Iteration abstraction: allows us to iterate over items in a collection without revealing details of how the items are obtained.
- Type hierarchy allows us to abstract individual data types to families of related types
