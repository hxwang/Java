4.3 Programming with Exceptions
===

### Handle Exceltion
- Some are handled **specifically**: the catch clause attempts to respond to the specific situation that gave rise to the exception
- Other exceptions are handled **generically**: in this case, the catch clause does not attempt to deal with the exception in any specific way. 
	- it might stop the program after reporting the problem to a user
	- or it might stop the program after reverting to an earlier state, without an attempt to fix the exact problem

### 4.3.1 Reflecting and Masking
There are two ways to deal with an exception.
#### Reflecting
	- Idea: the exception is reflected up another level; that is, the caller also terminates by throwing an exception
	- How to implement
		- 1. can be accomplished by automatic propagation: limited, as the same exception object is thrown. While, we want to throw a different exception object, because the meaning of the information is changed. 
		- 2. or by explicitly catching an exception and then throwing an exception
		- `todo`: see examples
#### Masking
	- Idea: the caller masks the exception: handle the exception itself and then continues with the normal flow
	- Example: in sorting an array, if the array is empty, then it simply means it is sorted
