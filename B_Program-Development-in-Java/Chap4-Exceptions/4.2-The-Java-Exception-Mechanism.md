The Java Exception Mechanism
===

### 4.2.1 Exception Types
- Exception types are subtypes of either Exception or RuntimeException, both of which are subtype of type Throwable. 
	- checked exceptions: e.g. IOException
	- unchecked exceptions: e.g. NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException
	- In the following figure, red is unchecked unchekced exception
	- ![The exception type hierarchy](https://github.com/hxwang/Java/blob/master/B_Program-Development-in-Java/Chap4-Exceptions/ExceptionHierarchy.png)
- Checked exceptions v.s. unchecked exceptions
	- List in the header: if the procedure might throw a checked exception, Java requires that the exception b e listed in the procedure's header; otherwise, there will be a compile-time error. Unchecked exceptions need not to be listed in the header
	- Handled in the calling code: checked exception needs, while unchecked not `todo`
	
### 4.2.2 Defining Exception Types
- Type: its declaration indicates whether it is checked or unchecked by indicating its supertype
	- if the super type is Exception, then it is checked
	- if the super type is RuntimeException, then it is unchecked
	
- Define example
	- a class defining a new exception type need only **define constructors**
	- defining a new exception type requires very little work because most of the code for the new type is **inherited** from the class that implements its supertype
```
Define a new exception type

public class NewKindOfException extends Exception{
	
	public NewKindOfException() {super();}
	public NewKindOfException(String s) {super(s);}
	//the string will explain why the exception throws
	//e.g. Exception e1 = new NewkindOfException("this is the reason");
}
```
	
	
### 4.2.3 Throwing Exceptions
- A Java procedure can terminate by throwing an exception. 
```
if(n<=0) throw new NonPositiveExceotpion("Num.fact");
```

- What to put in the string?
	- a good way is to have the string identify the procedure that threw the exception, since in general many procedures will throw the same exception type
	- beside, if a method is overloaded, the types of its arguments must also be given
	
### 4.2.4 Handling Exceptions
- Approach 1: using the try statement
	- e.g. 
	```
	try{ x = Num.fact(y);}
	catch( NonPositiveException e){
		// in here can use e
	}
	```
	- note several catch clauses can be attacked to he try statement so several different exceptions can be handled
	- also try statement can be ***nested**, if an exception thrown by the body of the inner try statement is not caught by one of its catch clauses, it can be caught by one of the catch clauses of the outer try statement
	- the catch clause **do not have to identify** the actual type of an exception object
	```
	try { x = Arrays.search(v,y); }
	catch(Exception e){ s.println(e); return;}
	```

- Approach 2: propagate
	- This occurs when a call within some procedure P signals an exception that is not handled by a catch clause of any containing try statement in P. 
	- In this case, Java automatically **propagates the exception to P's caller** provides one of the following is true:
		- that exception type or one of its supertypes listed in P's header
		- the exception type is unchekced
	- Otherwise, there will be a **compile-time** error.

### 4.2.5 Coping with Unchecked Exceptions
- Intro
	- Any call can potentially thrown an unchecked exception. This means we have a problem in catching unchecked exceptions because it's hard to know where they come from
- Coping
	- the only way to be certain about the origin of the unchecked exception is to **narrow the scope of the try statement**. For example, it is certain the exception comes from the array access in the following code:
```
try{ x = y[n];}
catch(IndexOutOfBoundsException e){
	//handle IndexOutOfBoundsException from the array access y[n]
}
i = Arrays.search(z,x);
```
