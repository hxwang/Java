The Java Exception Mechanism
===

### 4.2.1 Exception Types
- Exception types are subtypes of either Exception or RuntimeException, both of which are subtype of type Throwable. 
	- checked exceptions: e.g. IOException
	- unchecked exceptions: e.g. NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException
	- In the figure, red is unchecked unchekced exception

- Checked exceptions v.s. unchecked exceptions
	- List in the header: if the procedure might throw a checked exception, Java requires that the exception b e listed in the procedure's header; otherwise, there will be a compile-time error. Unchecked exceptions need not to be listed in the header
	- Handled in the calling code: checked exception needs, while unchecked not `todo`
