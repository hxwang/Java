The Java Exception Mechanism
===

### 4.2.1 Exception Types
- Exception types are subtypes of either Exception or RuntimeException, both of which are subtype of type Throwable. 
	- checked exceptions: e.g. IOException
	- unchecked exceptions: e.g. NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException
	- In the figure, red is unchecked unchekced exception
	![The exception type hierarchy](https://github.com/hxwang/Java/blob/master/B_Program-Development-in-Java/Chap4-Exceptions/ExceptionHierarchy.png)
- Checked exceptions v.s. unchecked exceptions
	- List in the header: if the procedure might throw a checked exception, Java requires that the exception b e listed in the procedure's header; otherwise, there will be a compile-time error. Unchecked exceptions need not to be listed in the header
	- Handled in the calling code: checked exception needs, while unchecked not `todo`
	
### 4.2.2 Defining Exception Types
- Type: its declaraiton indicates whether it is checked or unchecked by indicating its supertype
	- if the super type is Exception, then it is checked
	- if the super type is RuntimeException, then it is unchecked
	
- Example
```
Define a new exception type

public class NewKindOfException extends Exception{
	
	public NewKindOfException() {super();}
	public NewKindOfException(String s) {super(s);}
	//the string will explain why the exception throws
	//e.g. Exception e1 = new NewkindOfException("this is the reason");
}
```
	- a class defining a new exception type need only **define constructors**
	- defining a new exception type requires very little work because most of the code for the new type is **inherited** from the class that implements its supertype
