4.5 Defensive Programming
==========

#### Definition
- Defensive programming: writing each procedure to defend itself against errors introduced by other procedures, by hardware, or by the user entering data

### Check requires clauses
- If the requires clauses is not satisfied
	- Solution 1: half the program with an error message if the check fails
		- Cons: not robust
	- Solution 2: use the exception mechanism because then, if the call occurs in a context in which a higher level can recover from problems in a generic way(e.g. by doing a restart)
	
### FailureException
- What: it is a particular exception type devote to the situation such as the **requires clauses not being satisfied**.
	- This exception indicates that something is broken so that the procedure is unable to satisfy its specification.
- How to use?
	- Header of the procedure should not list `FailureException`, and their specifications should not mention throwing it. The reason is that this exception is used for situations that do not correspond to what is described in a procedure's specification
- When to use?
	- `FailureException` should be raised whenever your code checks an assumption that should hold and discover it doesn't
