7.5 Exception Types
-----

- All exception types are subtypes of `Throwable`
- The implementation of `Throwable` provides methods that access the string within the exception object
- We could define Exception type with additional methods 
	- In the following example, the constructor require an `int` argument, and its method, `valueOf`, allow programs to access the int
	``` java
	//An exampletion type with more information
	public MyException extends Exception{
		//OVERVIEW: MyException objects contain an int ass well as a string
		private int val;
		
		public MyException(String s, int v){super(s); val = v;}
		public myException(intv){super(); val=v;}
		public int valueOf(){return val;}
	}
	```
