7.2 Defining a Type Hierarchy
===

- define the type at the top of the hierarchy
	- this type may be incomplete, e.g., lacking constructors

#### Subtype specification
	- it must define the subtype **constructor**
	- + any extra methods 

#### Supertype implementation
- some aren't implemented
- some partial implemented
- a supertype implementation may provide extra information to potential subtypes, givint them access to instance variables or to methods that users can't call

### Subtype implementation
- subtype implemented as extensions of the supertype implementation
- **Reps** of subtype objects contain within them the instance variables defined in the implementation of the supertype. 
- reimplementation are allowed
