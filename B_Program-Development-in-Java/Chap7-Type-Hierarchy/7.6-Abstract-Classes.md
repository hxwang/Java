7.6 Abstract Classes
---

#### User of Protected Members
- It is desirable to avoid the use of protected members for two reasons
	- without them, the superclass can be reimplemented without affecting the reimplementation of any subclass
	- and protected members are package visible, which means that other code in the package can interfere with the superclass implementation
- Protected members are introduced to enable efficient implementation of subclasses. There can be protected instance variable, or the instance variable might be private, with access given via protected methods. The latter approach is worth while if it allows the superclass to maintain a meaningful invariant.

### Abstract Classes
- It may have some instance variables, and if it does, it will also have one or more constructors.
- The constructors cannot be called by its users, since an abstract class has no objects, but the constructors can be used by subclasses to initialize the superclass's part of the rep.

- The nonabstract can call the abstract class, and the abstract class can be left for the subclasses to filling in the details.

- Rep
	- if the superclass has no rep invariant, then its `repOk` method is abstract

- Subclass can be continue to be abstract. They might continue to list some of the abstract superclass methods as abstract. 

###Examples
#### Specification of SortedIntSet
``` java
public class SortedIntSet extends IntSet{
	//OVERVIEW: A sorted int set is an int set whose elements are accessible in sorted order
	
	//constructors
	public SortedIntSet()
		//EFFECTS: Makes this be the empty sorted set 
	
	//methods
	public Iterator elements()
		//EFFECTS: Returns a generator that will produce all elements of this,
		// each exactly once, in ascending order;
		//REQUIRES: this not be modified while the generator is in use 
		
	public int max() throw EmptyException
		//EFFECTS: If this is empty throws EmptyException else returns
		// the largement element of this 
		
	public boolean subset(SortedIntSet s)
}
```

#### Implementation of abstract IntSet{
``` java
public abstract class IntSet{
	protected int sz; //the size
	
	//constructors 
	public IntSet() {sz = 0;}
	
	//abstract methods
	public abstract void insert(int  x);
	public abstract void remove(int x);
	public abstract Iterator elements();
	public abstract boolean repOk();
	
	//methods
	public boolean isIn(int x){
		Iterator g = elements();
		Integer z = new Integer(x);
		while(g.hasNext())
			if(g.next().equals(z)) return true;
		return false;		
	}
	
	public int size() {return sz;}
	
	//implementation of subset and toString go here
}
```

#### Partial Implementation of SortedIntSet
``` java
public class SortedIntSet extends IntSet{
	private OrderedIntList els;
	//the abstraction function is:
	//AF(c) = c.els[1],...,c.els[c.sz]
	//the rep invariant is: c.els!=null && c.sz = c.els.size 
	
	public SortedIntSet() {els = new OrderedIntList();}
	
	public int max() throws EmptyException{
		if(sz==0) throw new EmptyException("SortedIntSet.max");
		return els.greatest();
	}
	
	public Iterator elements() {return els.elements();}
	
	public boolean subset(IntSet s){
		try{return subset((SortedIntSe)s);}
		catch(ClassCastException e){return super.subset(s);}
	}
	
	public boolean subset(SortedIntSet s){
		//implementation in here take advantage of fact that 
		//smallToBig of OrderedIntList return els in ascending order 
		...
	}
	
	//implementations of insert, remove and repOk go here
}
```
