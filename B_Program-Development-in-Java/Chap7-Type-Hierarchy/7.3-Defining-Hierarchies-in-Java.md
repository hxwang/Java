7.3 Defining Hierarchies in Java
===

#### Inheritance mechanism
- type hirarchies are defined in Java using `inheritance mechanism`
- this mechanism allow one class to be a subclass of one other class(its super class) and to implement zero or more interfaces

- Interface: only define a specification, it does not contain any code implementing the supertype



#### Classes
- **Concrete classes**: provide a full implementation of the type
- **Abstract classes**: provide at most a partial implementation of the type, they have no objects, since some of their methods are not implemented, and using code cannot call their constructors
	- can have **abstract methods** that are not implemented by the superclass and therefore, must be implemented by some subclass
- both classes can contain normal methods and **final methods**
	- final methods: cannot be reimplemented by subclasses

#### Protected
- the representation of a subclass object consists of the instances variable declared for the superclass and those declared for the subclass.
- when implementing the subclass, it may be necessary to have access to the representation details of the superclass implementation
	- this will be possible only if the superclass made parts of its implemented accessible to the subclass
	- this can be achieved using **protected methods**
- The superclass can declare protected methods, constructors, and instance variables that are visible to subclass. However, protected members also **package visible**.

#### Summary
- Every class does not explicitly extend some other class implicitly extends Object
- A supertype is defined by either a `class` or an `interface`, which provides its specification and, in the case of the class, provides a partial or complete implementation
- An abstract class provides only a partial implementation; it has no objects and no constructors that users can call
- A subclass can inherit the implementation of this superclas's methods, but it can also `override` those implementations(for `nonfinal` methods)
- The rep of a subclass consists of its own instance variables and those of its superclass, but it can access the superclass instance variables only if they are declared to be `protected`.
