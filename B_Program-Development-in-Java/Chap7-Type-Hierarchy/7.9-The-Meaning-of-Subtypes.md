The Meaning of Subtypes
---

### Three Properties
- substitution Principle
	- Subtype must satisfy the substitution principle so that users can **write** and **reason** about code just using the supertype specification
- Three properties must be supported
	- Signature Rule: the subtype objects must have all the methods of the supertype, and the signatures of the subtype methods must be compatible with the signatures of the corresponding supertype methods.
	- Methods Rule: Calls of these subtype methods must behave like calls to the corresponding supertype methods
	- Properties Rule: The subtype must preserve all properties that can be proved about supertype objects.
- Java's notation of **compatibility** is a little stricter than necessary
	- e.g. the rturn type of the sub and super method must be **identical**.

### Reasoning about the Substitution Principle
- The signature rule ensures that if a program is type-correct based on the supertype specification, it is also type-correct with respect to the subtype specification.
- The methods rule ensures that reasoning about calls of supertype mthods is valid even though the calls actually go to code that implements a subtype
- The properties rule ensures that reasoning about propertiesof objects based on the supertype specification is still valid when objects belong to a subtype. The properties must be stated in the overview section of the supertype specification.
	
### 7.9.1 The Methods Rule
- Although the code of subtype is used, we can still do the reasoning
- A subtype can **weaken** the procondition and can **strenthen** the post condition
	- Procondition Rule: Pre_super => pre_sub
	- Postcondition RUle: Pre_super && post_sub => post_super
- Note
	- Procondition Rule: e.g. supertype requires this is not empty, while subtype have not requirements (valid)
	- Postcondition: e.g. if 0 supertype and subtype return 0; if 1 subtype return 1, supertype of no definition of what to do if 1(valid)
	
### 7.9.2 The Properties Rule
- **evolution property**:  e.g. immutability

### Equality
- Mutable: must be the same objects (or there may be different in the future)
- Immutable: have the same state
- Example, p2 point is 2-space, p3 point is 3-space, p3 needs to override the equal function
``` java
//Partial implementation of Point 3
public class Point3 extends Point2{
	private int z; //the z coordinate
	
	public boolean equals(Object p){
		//override definition
		if(p instanceof Point3) return equals((Point3)p);
	}
	
	public boolean equals(Point2 p){
		//overriding definition
		if(p instanceof Point3) return equals((Point3) p);
	}
	
	public boolean equals(Point3 p){
		//extra definition
		if(p==null || z!=p.z) return false;
		return super.equals(p);
	}
}
```
