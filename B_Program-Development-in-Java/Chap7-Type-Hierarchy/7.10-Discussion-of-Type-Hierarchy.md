Discussion of Type Hierarchy

### Kinds of Supertypes
- **Incomplete supertypes** establish naming conventions for subtype methods but do not provide useful specifications for those methods. Therefore, using code is typically not written in terms of them.

- **Complete supertypes** provide entire data abstraction, with useful specification for all the methods

- **Snippets** provide just a few methods, not enough to qualify as an entire data abstraction. However, those methods are specified in a way that allows using code to be written in terms of the supertype.
	-e.g. `cloneable`, note snippets are always defined by **interfaces**
