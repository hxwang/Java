### Modification
- Usually neither the generator nor the loop body will modify the collection

- However, if modification is necessary, one approach is to require the generator to produce the elements contained in its collection arugment at the time it is created by the iterator, even if modifications occur later. However, this is not efficient in implementation?

- One example when modification is necessary
	- current task generate new task, enqueue the new task to task queue
	``` java
	Iterator g = q.allTasks();
	while(g.hasNext()){
		Task t = (Task) g.next();
		//perform t 
		//if t generates a new task nt, enqueue it by performing q.enq(nt)
	}
