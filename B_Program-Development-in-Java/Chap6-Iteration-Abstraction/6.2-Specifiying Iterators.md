6.2 Specifying Iterators
===

- **A generator has no specification of its own**. The specification of an iterator defines the behavior of the generator.

- The specification of an iterator explains the whole iteration
	- how the iterator uses its arguments to **produce a generator**
	- the behavior of the generator

### Two iterator methods
``` java
public class Poly{
	public Iterator terms()
		//EFFECTS: Returns a generator that will produce exponents
		// of nonzero terms of this(as Integers) up to the degree,
		// in order of icnreasing exponent
}

public class IntSet{
	public Iterator elements(){}
		//EFFECTS: Returns a generator that will produce all the elements  of
		// this(as Integers), each exactly once, in arbitrary order.
		//REQUIRES: this must not be modified while the generator is in use.
}
```

### Explain
- For `elements()`, we state the `REQUIRE` clause at the **end** of the specification. Normally, it will be put in the very first part of the specification. But since this is a requirement on the **use of the generator**, rather than on the **call to the iterator**.


### Static methods
- It is possible to hae a standalone iterators, they will be static methods. 
``` java
public class Num{
	
	public static Iterator allPrims()
		//EFFECTS: Returns a generator that will produce all primes
		// (as Integers), each exactly once, in increasing order
}
```
