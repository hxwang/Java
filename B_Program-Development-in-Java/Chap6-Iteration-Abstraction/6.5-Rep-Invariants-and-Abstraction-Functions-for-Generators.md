6.5 Rep Invariants and Abstraction Function for Generators
===
- We need to define `rep invariants` and `abstractions functions` for generators just as we do for ordinary abstract types

### Rep Invariants
- Different from traditional ways, we will not provide a method to check them. The rep invariants for `PolyGen` is
	``` java
	// c.p !=null && (0<=c.n<=c.p.deg)
	```
- The rep invariant for PrimesGene is
	``` java
	// c.ps is not null and
	//   all elements of c.ps are primes, and they are sorted in ascending order
	//   and they incldue all primes <c.p and >2
	```
### Abstraction Function
- To define the abstraction function for a generator, we need to understand what the abstract state of a generator is. 
	- All generator have the same abstract sate: a sequence of the items that remain to be generated. 
	- Tus, the abstraction function needs to **map** the `rep` to this sequence 
- Example: abstraction function for `PrimsGen`
	``` java
	//AF(c) = {p1,p2,...} such that
	// each p_i is an Integer and p_i is a prime and p_i > c.p and 
	// every prime >=c.p is in the sequence and 
	// p_i > p_j for i>j>=1
	```
	
- Example: abstraction function for `PolyGen`
	``` java
	// AF(c) = {x_1,...,x_n} such that
	// each x_i is an Integer and 
	// every index i>=n of a nonzero element of c.p.trms is in 
	// the sequence and no other elements are in the sequence
	// and x_i > x_j for all i>j>=1
	```
