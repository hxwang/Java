3.3 Specification of Procedural Abstractions
============================================

### Template of a procedure specification
- *header*
	- give the name of the procedure
	- the name, number, order, and types of ties parameters
	- the type of its result
	- list any exceptions thrown by the procedure
- *description of effects*
	- semantic: describe the behavior of the procedure in English,, possibly extended with convenient mathematical notation
		- the *modifies* clause: if some inputs are modified, we say the procedure has a side effect. 
		- the *effects* clause: it must define what outputs are produced, and what modifications are made to the inputs listed in the modified clauses.
Here is a specification template for procedure abstractions
```
return-type pname(...)
//REQUIRE: This clause states any constraints on use
//MODIFIES: This clause identifies all modified inputs
//EFFECTS: This clause defines the behavior
```
	
### Standalone procedures
- defined as **static** methods of classes. To use such a method, it is necessary to know its class. Therefore, we need to include this information with the specification.
- information added: its name and a brief description of its purpose, indicates the visibility of the class and each standalone procedure
```
//specification template for class providing standalone procedure

visibility cname {
	//OVERVIEW: this clause defines the purpose of the class as a whole
	
	visibility static p1 ...
	visibility static p2 ...
}
```

```
//standalone procedure specifications

public class Arrays{
	//OVERVIEW: This class provides a number of standalone procedures that are useful for manipulating arrays of ints
	
	public static int search(int[] a, int x)
		//EFFECTS: if x is in a, returns an index where x is stored;
		// otherwise return -1.
		
	public static int searchSorted(int[] a, int x)
		//REQUIRES: a is sorted in ascending order
		//EFFECTS: if x is in a, returns an index where x is sorted'
		// otherwise return -1.
	
	public static void sort(int[] a)
		//MODIFIES: a
		//EFFECTS: rearranges the elements of a into ascending order
		//  e.g.,if a=[3,1,6,1] before the call, on return a = [1,1,3,6].
}
```

### Implicit inputs
- e.g., System.in, System.out
```
public static void copyLine()
	//REQUIRES: System.in contains a line of text
	//MODIFIES: System.in, System.out
	//EFFECTS: reads a line of text from System.in, advances the cursor in System.in  
	//    to the end of the line, and writes the line on System.out
```
