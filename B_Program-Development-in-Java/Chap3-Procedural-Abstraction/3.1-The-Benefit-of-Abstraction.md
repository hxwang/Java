3.1 The Benefit of Abstraction
==============================

###Idea
	- Abstract from the details of implementing that behavior
		- Relevant: "what" is done
		- Irrelevant: "How" is done
### Benefit
	- Locality: the implementation of an abstraction can be read or written without needing the examine the implementation of any other abstraction
	- Modifiability: An abstraction can be implemented without requiring changes to any abstractions that use it
