3.2 Specification
=================

- What?
	- We define abstraction by means of *specifications*, which are written in a specification language that can be either *formal* or *informal*.
		- Formal: the advantage is that they have a precise meaning
		- Informal: the advantage is that they are easier to read or write
	- Specification are usually quite different from programs because they focus on describing what the abstraction is rather than how it is implemented.
