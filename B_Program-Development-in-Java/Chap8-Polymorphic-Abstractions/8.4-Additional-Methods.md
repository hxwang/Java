Additional Methods
----

- `Comparable`: is a supertype, whose subtypes have a comparison method 

#### Example: OrderedList
- a polymorphic version of 	`OrderedIntList`
	- `compareTo` throws an exception when the objects aren't comparable
	- the type of element in the list is determined when the first element is added; if the list becomes emtpy, this type can switch to something different when the next element is added
	
#### The Comparable Interface
``` java
public interface Comparable{
	//OVERVIEW: Subtypes of Comparable provide a method to determine the ordering of their objects
	//  This ordering must be a total order over their objects, and it should be both transitive and symmetric
	//  Furthermore x.compareTo(y) == 0 implies x.equals(y)
	
public int compareTO(Object x) throws ClassCastException, NUllPointerException
	//EFFECTS: If x is null, throw NullPointerException
	//  if this and x aren't comparable, throws ClassCastException
	//  otherwise, if this is less than x return -1
	//  if this is greater than x, return 1
}
```

#### Partial specification and implementation of ordered lists
``` java
public class OrderedList{
	//OVERVIEW: An ordered list is a mutable ordered list of Comparable objects
	// A typical list is a sequence [x_1,...,x_n] where x_i <x_j if i<j
	// The ordering of the elments is done using their compareTo methods
	
	private boolean emtpy;
	private OrderedList left, right;
	private Comparable val;
	
	//constructor
	public OrderedList(){
		//EFFECTS: Initialize this to be an empty ordered list
		empty = true;
	}
	
	//methods
	public void addE1(Comparable e1) throws NullPointerException, Duplicate Exception, ClassCastException{
		//MODIFIES: this
		//EFFECTS: If el is in this, throws DuplicateException
		// if el is null, throws NullPointerException
		// if el cannot be compared to this, throws ClassCastException
		// otherwise add el to this
		if(val==null) throw new NUllPointerException("OrderedList.addE1");
		if(empty){
			left = new OrderedList(); right = new OrderedList();
			val =  el; empty = false; return;
		}
		int n = el.comparedTo(val);
		if(n==0) throw New DuplicateException("OrderedList.addE1");
		if(n<0) left.addE1(e1); else right.addE1(e1);
	}
	
	public void remE1 (Comparable e1) throws NotFoundException
		//MODIFIES: this
		//EFFECTS: If e1 is not in this, throws NotFoundException
		// otherwise, remove e1 from this
		
	public boolean isIn(Comparable e1)
		//EFFECTS: If e1 is in this returns true else returns false
}
