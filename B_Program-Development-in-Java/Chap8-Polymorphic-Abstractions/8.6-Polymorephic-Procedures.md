Polymorphic Procedures
---

The same techniques can be used for procedures

``` java
//some polymorphic procedures

class Vector{
	//OVERVIEW: Provides useful procedures for manipulating vectors
	
	public static int search(Vector v, Object o) throws NotFoundException, NullPointerException
		//EFFECTS: If v is null throws NullPointereXception, else if o is in v
		// return an index where o is stored else throws NotFoundException
		// uses equals to compare o with the element of v
		
	public static sort(Vector v) throws ClassCastException
		//MODIFIEs: v
		//EFFECTS: If v is not null, sorts it into ascending order using the compareTo method of comparable
		// if some element of v are null or aren't comparable throw ClassCastException
		
	public static sort(Vector v, Comparator c) throws ClassCastException
		//MODIFIES: v
		//FFECTS: If v is not null, sorted it into the ascending order using the compare method of c
		// if some elements of v are null or aren't comparable using c throws ClassCastException
}
