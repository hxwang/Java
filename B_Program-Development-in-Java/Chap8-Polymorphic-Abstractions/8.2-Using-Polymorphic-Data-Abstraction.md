8.2 Using Polymorphic Data Abstraction
----

#### Difference from nonpolymorephic counterparts
- Only `objects` can be stored in the collection, and therefore, primitive value like `ints` must be wrapped in their corresponding object type
- Observers that return elements of the collection will return `Object`, and therefore the using code will need to **cast** to the expected type, in the case of primitive value, unwrapped.
- Example: here the code that uses Set to stored a collection of ints
``` java
Set s = new Set();
s.insert(new Integer(3));
...
Iterator g = s.elements();
while(g.hasNext()){
	int i = ((Integer) g.next()).intValue();
	...
}
```
