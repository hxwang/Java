Equality Revisited
----

### Distinguish Vectors
- Vector: two vectors are equal if they have the same state
- Therefore, in the following code `y` will not be add to the set, as it has the same state with `x`
	``` java
	Set s = new Set();
	Vector x = new Vector();
	Vector y = new Vector();
	s.insert(x);
	s.insert(y);//y is not added to s since it appears to be in it already
	```
- If you would like to distinguish y from x, one solution is to **wrap the vectors with container objects**
	``` java
	Set s = new Set();
	Vector x = new Vector();
	Vector y = new Vector();
	s.insert(new Container(x));
	s.insert(new Container(y));
	x.add(new Integer(3));
	if(s.isIn(new Container(y))); //will get here
	```

### The container type and its implementation
``` java
public class Container{
	//OVERVIEW: A container contains a single object
	// two containers are equals if they contain the very same object. Containers are immutable
	
	private Object al;
	
	//constructor
	public Container (Object x){
		//EFFECTS: Makes this contain x
		el = x;
	}
	
	//methods 
	public Object get(){
		//EFFECTS: Returns the object in the container
		return el;
	}
	
	public boolean equals(Object x){
		if(!x instanceOf container) return false;
		return (el==((Container)x.el));
	}
}
```
