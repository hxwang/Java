Properties of Data Abstraction
- A data abstraction is **mutable** if it has any mutator methods; otherwise, the data abstraction is immutable.
- There are for kinds of operations provided by data abstractions. 
	- **create** produce new objects "from scratch";All creators are constructors. Most constructors are creators.
	- **producers** produces new objects given existing objects as arguments; e.g. `add` and `mul` are producer for `Poly`.
	- **mutator** modify the state of their objects; `insert` and `remove` are mutators for `IntSets`. Clearly, only mutable types can have mutators.
	- **observers** provide information about the state of the objects. e.g. `size`, `isIn`.
- A data type is **adequate** if it provides enough operations so that whatever users need to do with its objects can be done conveniently and with reasonable efficiency

- ### Mutability
	- Immutable 
		- Pros: safer
		- Cons: new objects may be created and discarded frequently for immutable abstractions, which means that storage management work (e.g., garbage collection) is done more frequently.
