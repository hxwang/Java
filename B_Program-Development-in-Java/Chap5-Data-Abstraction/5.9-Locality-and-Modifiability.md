5.9 Locality and Modifiability
===

### Locality
- A data abstraction implementation provides locality if using code cannot modify components of the rep; thiat is, it must be expose the rep

### Modifiability
- A data abstraction implementation provide modification if, in addition, there is not way for using code to access any part of the rep.
- It is more restricted than Locality.
- Definition: The ability to reimplement an abstraction without having to reimplement any other code.
