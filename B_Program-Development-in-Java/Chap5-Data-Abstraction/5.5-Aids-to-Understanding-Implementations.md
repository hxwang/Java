5.5 Aids to Understanding Implementations
===

The **abstraction function** and the **representation invariant** are useful in understanding of a data abstraction.

- Abstraction function: captures the designer's intent in choosing a particular representation. 
- Rep: what instance variables to use and how they relate to the abstract object they are intended to represent

### 5.5.1 The Abstraction Function
- ##### Format
	- AF: E-> A
		- E: a concrete state
		- A: an abstract state
		- many-to-one relation
	- Example
		- objects with various els components -> IntSet states, [1,2] and [2,1] all maps to IntSet{1,2}. 
		- the process of abstraction involves forgetting irrelevant information, in the above example, the order in which the elements appear in the els component is irrelevant.

- #### Description
	- The abstraction function defines the meaning of the representation, the way in which the objects of the class are supposed to implement the abstract objects.
		- It should always be described in a comment in the implementation.
		
	- For the description, we give a description of a **typical** abstract object.
		``` java
		//A typical IntSet is {x_1,...,x_n}
		```
	- Then we can say 
		``` java
		//The abstraction function is
		// AF(c) = {c.els[i].intValue | 0<=i<=c.els.size}
		```
	- Another example for Poly
		``` java
		//A typical Poly is c0 + c1*x + c2*x^2 + ...
		//The abstract function is
		// AF(c) = c0 + c1*x + c2*x^2 + ...
		//  where ci = c.trms[i] if 0<=i<c.trms.size 
		//			 = 0 otherwise
		```
		
	- Abstraction function need not be provided for **record** types. A record type provides no abstraction over its rep; its rep is a collection of fields and so are abstract objects. Therefore, its abstraction is always the identity map.

### 5.5.2 The Representation Invariant
##### Definition
- A statement of a property that all legitimate objects satisfy is called a representation invariant, or rep invariant. A rep invariant J is a predicate, that is true of legitimate objects.
	- J: E -> boolean
	- example
	``` java
	//The rep invariant is:
	// c.els != null &&
	//  for all integers i, c.els[i] os an integer &&
	//  for all integers i, j, (0 <=i<j<c.els.size => 
	//      c.els[i].intValue != c.els[j].intValue)
	```
	
##### Example: IntSet
Consider an alternative representation of IntSets that consists of an array of 100 boolean plus a vector:
``` java
private boolean[100] els;
private Vector otherEls;
private int sz; //size 

- The abstraction function
``` java
//The abstraction function is
// AF(c) = {c.otherEls[i].intValue | 0<=i <c.otherEls.size} 
//    + {j | 0<=j<100 && c.els[j]}
```

- The ret invariant 
``` java
// The rap invariant is
// c.els != null && c.otherEls !=null && c.els.size == 100 &&
// 	  all elements in c.otherEls are Integers &&
//    all elements in c.otherEls are not in the range of 0 to 99 &&
//    there are no duplicates in c.otherEls &&
//    c.sz = c.otherEls.size + (count of true entries in c.els)
```

##### Example: Poly
- the length of the array = degree + 1 
``` java
//The rep invariant is 
// c.trms !=null && c.trms.length>=1 && c.deg = c.trms.length -1
// && c.deg>0 => c.trms[deg]!=0
```

##### Other
- Sometimes all concrete objects are legal representations. Then we have
``` java
//The rep invariant is 
// true
```
	- e.g. for **record** types, record objects are used by accessing their fields directly. This means that using code will be able to modify the fields, which in turn means that the class implementing the record type cannot constrain the rep in any way.
	- these constraints will be ensured by the code that users the record objects and would show up in the rep invariant for that code. For example,
	```
	//for all elements e of c.trms
	// e is a Pair and e.exp>=0 and e.coeff!=0
	```
