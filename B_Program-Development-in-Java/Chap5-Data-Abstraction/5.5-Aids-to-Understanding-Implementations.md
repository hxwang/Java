5.5 Aids to Understanding Implementations
===

The **abstraction function** and the **representation invariant** are useful in understanding of a data abstraction.

- Abstraction function: captures the designer's intent in choosing a particular representation. 
- Rep: what instance variables to use and how they relate to the abstract object they are intended to represent

### 5.5.1 The Abstraction Function
##### Format
- AF: E-> A
	- E: a concrete state
	- A: an abstract state
	- many-to-one relation
- Example
	- objects with various els components -> IntSet states, [1,2] and [2,1] all maps to IntSet{1,2}. 
	- the process of abstraction involves forgetting irrelevant information, in the above example, the order in which the elements appear in the els component is irrelevant.

#### Description
- The abstraction function defines the meaning of the representation, the way in which the objects of the class are supposed to implement the abstract objects.
	- It should always be described in a comment in the implementation.
