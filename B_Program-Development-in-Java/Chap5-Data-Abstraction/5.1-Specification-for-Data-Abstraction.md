5.1 Specification for Data Abstraction
===

New types are often be defined by **classes** or **interfaces**


### Format
#### How to define
- by defining a name for the type
- a set of constructors: used to initialize new objects of the type; these are instances
- a set of instance method or methods
	
#### Details
- Methods and constructors both belong to objects, rather than classes. Therefore, the keyword `static` will not appear in the methods' header.
- The object can be refer to by the methods or constructor as `this`
	``` java
	//the form of a data abstraction specification
	
	visibility class dname{
		//OVREVIEW: a brief description of the behavior of the typ's objects goes here
		
		//constructors
		//specs for constructor goes here
		
		//methods
		//specs for methods go here
	}
	```

### 5.1.1 Specification of IntSet
- IntSets
	- IntSets: unbounded sets of integers wtth operations 
		- to create a new, empty IntSet
		- test whether a given integer is an element of an IntSet
		- add or remove elements
- Specification of the IntSet data abstraction
``` java
public class IntSet{
	//OVERVIEW: IntSets are mutable, unbounded set of integers
	// A typical IntSet is {x1, x_2, ... , x_n}
	
	//constructors
	public IntSet()
		//EFFECTS: initialize this to be empty
		
	//methods
	public void insert(int x)
		//MODIFIES: this
		//EFFECTS: Adds x to the lements of this, i.e., this_post = this + {x}
		
	public void remove(int x)
		//MODIFIES: this
		//EFFECTS: Remove x from this, i.e., this_post = this - {x}
		
	public boolean isIn(int x)
		//EFFECTS: If x is in this returns true else return false
		
	pubic int size()
		//EFFECTS: Retuens the cardinality of this
		
	public int choose() throws EmptyException
		//EFFECTS: If this is empty, throw EmptyException else
		// returns an arbitrary element of this
}
```

### 5.1.2 The Poly Abstraction
- Polys: are polynomials with integer coefficients
	- Unlike IntSets, Polys are **immutable**, once a Poly has been created(and initialized by a constructor), it cannot be modified.
	- Operations are provided to create a one-term Poly and to add, subtract and multiply Polys

- Specification of the Poly data abstraction
	- The Poly type has 2 constructors
		- One to create the zero polynomial
		- One to create an arbitrary polynomial
	- Note `post` notation is not needed for immutable abstractions, since object state doesn't change, the pre and post states of objects are identical

	``` java
	public class Poly{
		//OVERVIEW: Polys are immutable polynomials with integer coefficients
		// A typical Poly is c0 + c1*x + ...
		
		//constructors
		public Poly()
			//EFFECTS: Initialize this to be the zero polynomial
		
		public Poly(int c, int n) throws NegativeExponentException
			//EFFECTS: if n<0 throws NegativeExponentException else
			// initialize this to be the Poly c*x^n
			
		//methods
		public int degree()
			//EFFECTS: Returns the degree of this, i.e. the largest exponent with a non-zero coefficient
			// Return 0 if this is the zero poly
			
		public int coeff(int d)
			//EFFECTS: Returns the coefficient of the term of this whose exponent is d
			
		public Poly add(Poly q) throws NullPointerException
			//EFFECTS: If q is null throws NullPointerException
			// else returns the Poly this+q
			
		public Poly mul(Poly q)
			//EFFECTS: If q is null throws NullPointerException
			// else returns the Poly this*q
			
		public Poly sub(Poly q)
			//EFFECTS: If q is null throws NullPointerException
			// else returns this - q
		
		public Poly minus()
			//EFFECTS: Returns the Poly - this
	}
	```
