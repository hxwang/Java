5.1 Specification for Data Abstraction
===

New types are often be defined by **classes** or **interfaces**


### Format
#### How to define
- by defining a name for the type
- a set of constructors: used to initialize new objects of the type; these are instances
- a set of instance method or methods
	
#### Details
- Methods and constructors both belong to objects, rather than classes. Therefore, the keyword `static` will not appear in the methods' header.
- The object can be refer to by the methods or constructor as `this`

	//the form of a data abstraction specification
	
	visibility class dname{
		//OVREVIEW: a brief description of the behavior of the typ's objects goes here
		
		//constructors
		//specs for constructor goes here
		
		//methods
		//specs for methods go here
	}
	```

### 5.1. Specification of IntSet
- IntSets
	- IntSets: unbounded sets of integers wtth operations 
		- to create a new, empty IntSet
		- test whether a given integer is an element of an IntSet
		- add or remove elements
- Specification of the IntSet data abstraction
```
public class IntSet{
	//OVERVIEW: IntSets are mutable, unbounded set of integers
	// A typical IntSet is {x1, x_2, ... , x_n}
	
	//constructors
	public IntSet()
		//EFFECTS: initialize this to be empty
		
	//methods
	public void insert(int x)
		//MODIFIES: this
		//EFFECTS: Adds x to the lements of this, i.e., this_post = this + {x}
		
	public void remove(int x)
		//MODIFIES: this
		//EFFECTS: Remove x from this, i.e., this_post = this - {x}
		
	public boolean isIn(int x)
		//EFFECTS: If x is in this returns true else return false
		
	pubic int size()
		//EFFECTS: Retuens the cardinality of this
		
	public int choose() throws EmptyException
		//EFFECTS: If this is empty, throw EmptyException else
		// returns an arbitrary element of this
}
```
