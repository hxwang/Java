5.4 Additional Methods
===

### Equals
- Two objects are equals if they are behavirally equivalent
	- Mutable objects are equals only if they are the **same objects**
	- Immutable objects are equals if they have the same state; immutable objects must implement equal themselves

### toString
- toString should return a string showing the type and current state of its objects, all types must implement toString themselves
- The implementation of `toString` contains: the type name of the object and its hash code
- toString method for IntSet
``` java
public String toString(){
	if(els.size()==0) return "IntSet:{}";
	String s = "IntSet: {" + els.elementAt(0).toString();
	for(int i=0; i<els.size(); i++)
		s = s+","+els.elementAt(i).toString();
	return s+"}";
}
```
### Similar
- Two objects are similar if it is not possible to distinguish between them using any observers of their type



### Clone
- Clone should return object that has the same state as its object
	- Mutable type must implement clone themselves
	- Immutable types can inherit clone from objects

- In general, the default implementation of clone function would be correct for `immutable` types and incorrect for `mutable` types
	- If the default implementation is correct, you can inherit it by putting implements `Cloneable` in the class header
	- If a class neither includes this clause nor provides an implementation of clone, then if the clone method is called on one of its objects, the code will throw `CloneNotSupportedException`.

### Implementation

- **Poly**
	- Poly implement equals but inherits `clone` from Object.
	``` java
	public class Poly implements Cloneable{
		
		public boolean equals(Poly q){
			if(q==null || deg!=q.deg) return false;
			for(int i=0; i<=deg; i++)
				if(trms[i]!=q.trms[i]) return false;
			return true;
		}
		
		public boolean equals(Object z){
			if(!(z instanceof Poly)) return false;
			return equals((Poly)z);
		}
	}
	```


- **IntSet**
	``` java
	public class IntSet{
		private IntSet(Vector v){ els = v;}
		
		public Object clone(){
			return new IntSet((Vector) els.clone());
		}
	}
	```

	- Usage
	``` java
	IntSet t = (IntSet) s.clone(); //need cast since clone return an object
	```
