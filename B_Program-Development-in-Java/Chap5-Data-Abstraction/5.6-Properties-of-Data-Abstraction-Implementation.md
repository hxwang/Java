5.6 Properties of Data Abstraction Implementations
===

### 5.6.1 Benevolent Side Effects
- A mutable abstraction must have a mutable rep or it will not be possible to provide the required mutability
- However, an **immutable** abstraction need not have an immutable rep
	- could have an immutable rep in Java by declaring all the instance variable to be **final**
	
- **Benevolent** side effects: modifications that are not visible outside the implementation

- Example: in the following code, the **modifications of rep** performed by the `equals` methods is a benevolent side effects
	- such side effects are often performed for reason of efficiency
	- they are possible whenever the abstract function is many-to-one, since then many rep objects represent a particular abstract object
	```  java
	//A benevolent side effect
	public class rat{
		private int num;
		private int demon;
		
		public boolean equals(rat r){
			if(r==null) return false;
			if(num==0) return r.num==0;
			if(r.num==0) return false;
			reduce();
			r.reduce();
			return (num==r.num && demon == r.demon);
		}
		
		private void reduce(){
			//REQUIRES: This.num!=0
			//MODIFIES: This
			//EFFECTS: change this to its reduced form
			int temp = num;
			if(num<0) temp = -num;
			it g = Num.gcd(temp,denom);
			num = num/g;
			denom = denom/g;
		}
	}
	```
	
	- the rep invariant
	``` java
	//The rep invariant is
	// c.denom>0
	```

### 5.6.2 Exposing the Rep
-  **Local reasoning**: ensure that a class is correct just by examining the code of that class
	- It is valid only if the representations of abstracts objects cannot be modified outside their implementation
	- If it is not supported, then we say the implementation **exposes the rep**.
- **Exposing the rep**: means that the implementation makes mutable components of the rep accessible to code outside the class

- **How**?
	- declare public instance variable 
	- or private instance variable, but have function like the follows
	``` jave
	public Vector all Els(){
		//EFFECTS: Returns a vector containing the elements of this, each exactly once, in arbitrary order
		
		return els;
	}
	```
- Note exposing the rep is an **ERROR!**, don't do it!
	``` java
	//example of exposing the rep
	public IntSet(Vector elms) throws NullPointerExpceiton{
		if(elms==null)
			throw new NullPointerExpceiton("IntSet 1 argument constructor");
		els = emls;
	}
	```
