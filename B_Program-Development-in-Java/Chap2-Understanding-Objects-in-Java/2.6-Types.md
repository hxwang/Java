Types
=====

### 2.6.1 Primitive Object Types
- Definition
	- Primitive type like **int** and **char** are not subtypes of Object
- Problem
	- their value cannot be used in contexts where objects are required, e.g. such values cannot be stored in vectors
- Solution
	- wrapping them in objects, e.g. Integer for int, Character for char. Such a type provides a constructor for producing one of its objects by wrapping a value of the associated primitive type, and a method to do the reverse transformation. For example, for integer we have:
	
	```
	public Integer(int x); //the constructor
	public int intValue(); //the method
	```
	- Those types also provide methods to produce objects from their associated types from strings, e.g.
	```
	int n = Integer.parseInt(s); //if s cannot be interpreted as an integer, the method will thrown NumberFormat Exception
	```
	- the types String and Object are defined in java.lang

### 2.6.2 Vectors

- Definition
	- Vectors are extensible arrays; they are empty when first created, and can grow and shrink from the high end
- Characteristic
	- Each element in the vector has the apparent type of Object
- Usage
	- when crated, it is empty, and its length is zero
	```
	Vector v = new Vector();
	```
	- can be made to grow by using the add method to its high end
	```
	v.add("abc");
	```
	- can be accessed for legal indices
	```
	String s = (String) v.get(0);
	```
	- set a particular lement
	```
	v.set(0,"def");
	```
	- shrink 
	```
	v.remove(0);
	```
	- primitive types such as int and char can be used with the associate types, e.g.
	```
	v.add(new Integer(3));
	int x = ((Integer) v.get(2)).intValue();
	```
