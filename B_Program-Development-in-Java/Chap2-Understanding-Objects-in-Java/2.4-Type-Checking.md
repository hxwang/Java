Type Checking
=============

### Definition
- Java is a strongly typed language, the Java compiler checks the code to ensure that every assignment and every call is type correct. 
- **Type safefy** is achieved by three mechanisms
	- compile-time type checking
	- automatic storage management
	- array bounds checking
- *apparent type*: is the type understood by the compiler from information available in declarations. 
- *actual type*: is the real type, i.e. the type it receives when created.
- Java guarantee the apparent type of any expression is a supertype of its actual type.
	
### 2.4.1 Type Hierarchy
- **Supertype**: type hierarchy provides a way of abstracting from the differences among subtypes to their common behavior, which is captured by their supertype.
- **Subtype**: the subtype relation is transitive.
- Java enforce *subtype* to have the same methods that *supertype* have. However, it does not enforce the methods call to behave in the same way. Because it beyond the abilities of a compiler. 
- **Object**
	- at the top of the type hierarchy in Java; all object types, including String and array types, are subtype of this type
	- it includes `equals` and `toString`, with the following header
	```
		boolean equals(Object o)
		String toString()
	```
	- `v=e` is legal, if v is a supertype, e is a subtype
	- **casting**: the use of cast causes a check to occur at runtime; if check succeeds, the indicated computation is allowed, and otherwise, the *ClassCastException* will be raised. 
		-e.g. `o1` is object type, `s` is String type, 
		```
		s = o1; //illegal
		s = (String)o1; //legal
		```
