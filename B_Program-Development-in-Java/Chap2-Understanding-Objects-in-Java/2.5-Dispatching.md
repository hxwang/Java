Dispatching
===========

### Call method
- When a method is called on some object, the call should go to code provided by the object being called, instead of the calling object.
	``` java
	String t = "ab";
	Object o = t + "c";
	String r = "abc";
	boolean b = o.equals(r);
	```
	- here the `equals()` method should be provided by String, rather than Object.
- Since the compiler only knows the apparent type of object, and from the example, apparent type of object cannot determined the code to call. Therefore, we need a way to **dispatch** method call to the code of the actual object.
	- This requires a runtime **mechanism** since the compiler cannot figure out what to do at runtime.

### Dispatch 
- How it works
	- each method contains a reference to a *dispatch vector*
	- the compiler generates code to access the location in the vector that points to the code of the method **being called** and branch to that code.
