2.2 Packages
============

### What?
- Classes and interfaces are grouped into packages.
- Purpose
	- They are encapsulation mechanism. They provide a way to share information within the package while preventing its use on the outside
	- For naming. Each package has a hierarchical name that distinguish it from all other packages. So there will be no name conflicts between classed and interfaces defined in different packages.
- Visibility
	- Only classed and interfaces declared to be public can be used by code in other packages

### Encapsulation and Naming
- Group many definitions in the same packages.
	- Pros: code outside the package can has access to all of the staff in the package by importing the whole package
	- Cons: code within a package can be sometimes access internal information of other definition within that package.
