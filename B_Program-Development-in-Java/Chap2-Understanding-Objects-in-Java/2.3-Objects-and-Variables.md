Objects and Variables
=====================

### Local Variables
- What? 
	- Those defined within methods.
- Where?
	- Space is allocated for them when the method is called and deallocated when the method returns.
- Values(Primitive types)
	- include int, boolean, and char
	- e.g. `int i=6`
- Objects
	- include strings, arrays, they contain references to object that reside in the heap
		- e.g. `int[] a= new int[3]`, space for a new array of integer object, with room for three integers will be allocated on the heap, and a reference to the new object will be stored in a
	- if the expression evaluates to a reference to an object, the reference is copied
		- e.g. s is an object, `t=s`, then t and s will point to the same object. This assignment involving reference to share object.
